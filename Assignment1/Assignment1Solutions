Que. Why should we (nearly) always use 3x3 kernels?

Ans.
In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix. 
It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image.
A convolution filter passes over all the pixels of the image in such a manner that, at a given time, we take 'dot product' of the convolution filter 
and the image pixels to get one final value output. We do this hoping that the weights (or values) in the convolution filter, 
when multiplied with corresponding image pixels, gives us a value that best represents those image pixels. 
We can think of each convolution filter as extracting some kind of feature from the image.

First we have to choose if a filter size should be small or large.

The advantages of using a smaller filter over a larger one are:
1. The features that would be extracted will be highly local and may not have a more general overview of the image. This helps capture smaller, complex features in the image. 
2. The amount of information or features extracted will be vast, which can be further useful in later layers.
3. We have better weight sharing due to the smaller convolution size that is applied on the complete image. 


Now we can choose between an odd number filters & an even size filters:
odd filters are preferable over even filters because if we were to consider the final output pixel (of next layer) that was obtained by convolving on the previous layer pixels, all the previous layer pixels would be symmetrically around the output pixel.
Without this symmetry, we will have to account for distortions across the layers. This will happen due to the usage of an even sized kernel.
Therefore, even sized kernel filters arenâ€™t preferred.

Now we can compare the smallest odd sized filters i.e, 1x1 , 3x3 & 5x5 filters

1. With smaller kernel sizes, we get lower number of weights and more number of layers. 
2. Due to the lower number of weights, this is computationally efficient. 
3. Due to the larger number of layers, it learns complex, more non-linear features.
4. With more number of layers, it will have to keep each of those layers in the memory to perform backpropogation.
   This necessitates the need for larger storage memory. 

Thus we can use filter size as small as possible. Thus we can eliminate 5x5 filter, leaving us with either 1x1 filter or a 3x3 filter as the preferred choice.

Now the 1X1 can be eliminated from the list as the features extracted from it would be fine grained and local, with no consideration for the neighboring pixels.
Hence, 3X3 works in most cases, and it often is the popular choice.
